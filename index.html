            <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otter">Otters</a></b> are carnivorous mammals in the
            subfamily
            Lutrinae. The 13 extant otter species are
            all
            semiaquatic,
            aquatic, or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates. Lutrinae is a branch of the
            Mustelidae
            family,
            which also includes weasels, badgers, mink, and wolverines, among other animals.
        </p>
        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The word otter derives from the Old English word otor or oter. This, and cognate words in other
            Indo-European
            languages, ultimately stem from the Proto-Indo-European language root *wódr̥, which also gave rise to
            the
            English word "water".<sup>[4]</sup>[5]</p>

        <h3>Hunting</h3>

        <p>
            Otters have been hunted for their pelts from at least the 1700s, although it may have begun well before
            then.
            Early hunting methods included darts, arrows, nets and snares but later, traps were set on land and guns
            used.

            There has been a long history of otter pelts being worn around the world. In China it was standard for
            the
            royalty to wear robes made from them. People that were financially high in status also wore them. The
            tails of
            otters were often made into items for men to wear. These included hats and belts. Even some types of
            mittens for
            children have been made from the fur of otters.[25]</p>
        <h3>Fishing for humans</h3>
        <p>
            For many generations, fishermen in southern Bangladesh have bred smooth-coated otters and used them to
            chase
            fish into their nets. Once a widespread practice, passed down from father to son throughout many
            communities in
            Asia, this traditional use of domesticated wild animals is still in practice in the district of Narail,
            Bangladesh.[29][30]</p>
